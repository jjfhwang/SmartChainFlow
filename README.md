# SmartChainFlow: A Rust-Based Orchestration Engine for Blockchain Interactions

SmartChainFlow is a robust and performant orchestration engine, implemented in Rust, designed to streamline and automate complex interactions with various blockchain networks. It provides a declarative approach to defining workflows, enabling developers to build sophisticated applications that leverage the power of decentralized technologies without getting bogged down in the intricacies of individual blockchain APIs.

This project aims to abstract away the complexities inherent in interacting with multiple blockchain protocols. Instead of writing intricate, platform-specific code for each transaction, contract interaction, or data retrieval operation, developers can define workflows using a simple, configuration-driven approach. SmartChainFlow then intelligently manages the underlying communication, transaction signing, and error handling, ensuring reliable and consistent execution across diverse blockchain environments. This significantly reduces development time, minimizes the potential for errors, and allows developers to focus on the core logic of their applications rather than the plumbing.

Furthermore, SmartChainFlow offers built-in monitoring and logging capabilities, providing real-time insights into the execution of workflows. This allows for proactive identification of potential issues, efficient debugging, and comprehensive auditing. The modular architecture of SmartChainFlow allows for easy extension and customization, enabling developers to integrate support for new blockchain protocols and adapt the engine to meet the specific requirements of their projects. By leveraging Rust's performance and safety guarantees, SmartChainFlow provides a secure and efficient foundation for building mission-critical blockchain applications.

Key Features

*   **Declarative Workflow Definition:** Workflows are defined using a YAML-based configuration language, allowing developers to specify the sequence of operations, data transformations, and conditional logic in a clear and concise manner. This separation of concerns simplifies development and maintenance.
*   **Multi-Blockchain Support:** SmartChainFlow is designed to be blockchain-agnostic. Currently supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana with plans to expand to other leading blockchain networks. Support for each blockchain is implemented through a dedicated module, simplifying the addition of new blockchains.
*   **Automatic Transaction Management:** The engine handles transaction signing, gas estimation, and error handling automatically, ensuring reliable transaction execution. Developers can configure parameters such as gas limits and priority fees through the workflow definition.
*   **Data Transformation and Mapping:** SmartChainFlow provides built-in data transformation capabilities, allowing developers to seamlessly map data between different formats and blockchain protocols. This is crucial for interoperability and data aggregation.
*   **Event-Driven Execution:** Workflows can be triggered by specific events on the blockchain, such as contract events or state changes. This enables reactive applications that respond dynamically to changes in the blockchain environment.
*   **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring:** The engine provides detailed logging and monitoring capabilities, allowing developers to track the progress of workflows, identify potential issues, and monitor the overall health of the system. Metrics are exposed via Prometheus for integration with existing monitoring infrastructure.
*   **Secure Key Management:** SmartChainFlow integrates with hardware security modules (HSMs) and other secure key management solutions to protect sensitive private keys.

Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The core engine is written in Rust, leveraging its performance, safety, and concurrency features.
*   **Tokio:** An asynchronous runtime for Rust, providing efficient and scalable handling of concurrent operations.
*   **Serde:** A serialization and deserialization framework for Rust, used for handling data in various formats (e.g., JSON, YAML).
*   **Web3.rs:** A Rust library for interacting with Ethereum-compatible blockchains.
*   **Solana-client:** A Rust client library for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
*   **Yaml-rust:** A pure Rust YAML 1.2 parser and emitter.
*   **Prometheus:** Used for exposing metrics for monitoring purposes.

Installation

1.  **Install Rust:** If you don't have Rust installed, download and install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the SmartChainFlow repository from GitHub:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/SmartChainFlow.git
3.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    cd SmartChainFlow
4.  **Build the Project:** Build the project using Cargo:
    cargo build --release
5.  **Locate the Executable:** The compiled executable will be located in the `target/release` directory.

Configuration

SmartChainFlow requires several environment variables to be configured before it can be used. These variables include:

*   `SCF_ETHEREUM_RPC_URL`: The URL of the Ethereum RPC endpoint.
*   `SCF_POLYGON_RPC_URL`: The URL of the Polygon RPC endpoint.
*   `SCF_SOLANA_RPC_URL`: The URL of the Solana RPC endpoint.
*   `SCF_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key used for signing transactions (use with caution in production environments). Alternatively, configure an HSM.
*   `SCF_LOG_LEVEL`: The log level (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`).

Example:

export SCF_ETHEREUM_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID>"
export SCF_PRIVATE_KEY="0x<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>"
export SCF_LOG_LEVEL="info"

Usage

To use SmartChainFlow, you need to define a workflow configuration file in YAML format. The configuration file specifies the sequence of operations to be executed.

Example:

workflow.yaml
---
name: TransferEth
steps:
  - name: Transfer
    blockchain: ethereum
    action: transfer
    from: "0x<YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>"
    to: "0x<RECIPIENT_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>"
    amount: 1000000000000000000 # 1 ETH in Wei

To execute the workflow, run the following command:

./target/release/smartchainflow --config workflow.yaml

The engine will parse the configuration file, execute the specified steps, and log the results.

For more detailed API documentation and examples, please refer to the project's documentation (coming soon).
