# SmartChainFlow: Autonomous Crypto-Arbitrage via Smart Contracts

SmartChainFlow is a decentralized platform for executing crypto-arbitrage strategies autonomously through smart contracts. By leveraging real-time price oracles and secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), SmartChainFlow aims to identify and capitalize on profitable arbitrage opportunities across different decentralized exchanges (DEXs) while mitigating risks and maximizing yield.

SmartChainFlow tackles the inefficiencies present in decentralized finance (DeFi) markets arising from price discrepancies between various DEXs. These discrepancies, often short-lived, present arbitrage opportunities. However, manually identifying and executing these opportunities is time-consuming, requires constant market monitoring, and is often inaccessible to the average user. SmartChainFlow automates this process by continuously monitoring price feeds from trusted oracles, analyzing potential arbitrage scenarios, and deploying smart contracts to execute trades across different DEXs when profitable conditions are met. The use of MPC adds a layer of security by distributing cryptographic keys amongst multiple parties, preventing any single point of failure and safeguarding the arbitrage funds. This decentralized and automated approach opens up arbitrage opportunities to a wider audience and ensures efficient market participation.

Our platform aims to deliver a transparent, secure, and efficient arbitrage solution. We prioritize code audibility and security through rigorous testing and formal verification processes. By employing MPC for key management and integrating with reputable oracle providers, we significantly reduce the risk of manipulation or unauthorized access. SmartChainFlow provides a robust framework for users to participate in decentralized arbitrage with confidence, fostering a more efficient and liquid DeFi ecosystem.

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous Arbitrage Execution:** Smart contracts automatically identify and execute arbitrage opportunities based on price data from decentralized oracles. The core logic is implemented in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly for efficient execution on blockchain platforms.

*   **Price Oracle Integration:** Integrates with multiple decentralized price oracles (e.g., Chainlink, Band Protocol) to provide real-time, accurate price feeds for various cryptocurrencies. A weighted average algorithm mitigates the impact of potential oracle inaccuracies.

*   **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC):** Utilizes MPC for secure key management and transaction signing, preventing single points of failure and protecting arbitrage funds. We are currently implementing a Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) based on the FROST algorithm.

*   **Dex Aggregation:** Supports multiple decentralized exchanges (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap) allowing for a wider range of arbitrage opportunities and increased liquidity. A custom router contract optimizes trade execution across different DEXs based on slippage and gas costs.

*   **Risk Management:** Implements various risk management parameters such as slippage tolerance, maximum trade size, and gas price limits to mitigate potential losses due to market volatility or unexpected network conditions. These parameters are configurable by the user.

*   **Gas Optimization:** Employs various gas optimization techniques, including efficient data structures and optimized smart contract code, to minimize transaction costs and maximize profitability.

*   **Simulation and Backtesting:** Provides simulation and backtesting tools to evaluate the performance of arbitrage strategies under different market conditions. Historical data can be imported to analyze potential profitability.

## Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** The primary programming language used for smart contract development, focusing on safety, performance, and concurrency. The Rust ecosystem provides excellent tooling for blockchain development.

*   **Solidity (for Proxy Contracts):** Solidity is utilized to deploy upgradeable proxy contracts that point to the core Rust-based logic. This allows for future upgrades and bug fixes without disrupting the deployed arbitrage strategies.

*   **WebAssembly (Wasm):** The compiled output of the Rust smart contracts. Wasm allows for high-performance execution on various blockchain platforms.

*   **Chainlink/Band Protocol:** Decentralized price oracles providing real-time, accurate price feeds.

*   **Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Libraries:** Libraries such as `tpm-rs` or `threshold-secret-sharing` are used for implementing the MPC protocol.

*   **Ethereum/Polygon (Target Blockchains):** The primary target blockchains for deploying and executing SmartChainFlow. Other chains may be supported in the future.

## Installation

1.  Install Rust:
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

2.  Install necessary Rust tools:
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

3.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/SmartChainFlow.git
    cd SmartChainFlow

4.  Install the necessary dependencies:
    cargo build --release

5.  Install `wasm-pack` for building the WebAssembly modules:
    cargo install wasm-pack

6. Build the Wasm smart contract:
    wasm-pack build --target web

## Configuration

The following environment variables are required for running SmartChainFlow:

*   `ORACLE_PROVIDER`: Specifies the price oracle provider (e.g., "Chainlink", "Band").
*   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key used to sign transactions. **Important: Use a dedicated key with limited funds for testing purposes.**
*   `DEX1_ADDRESS`: The address of the first decentralized exchange.
*   `DEX2_ADDRESS`: The address of the second decentralized exchange.
*   `SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE`: The maximum acceptable slippage percentage (e.g., 0.01 for 1%).
*   `GAS_PRICE_LIMIT`: The maximum acceptable gas price in Gwei.
*   `RPC_URL`: The URL of the blockchain RPC endpoint.

These variables can be set in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

## Usage

The core functionality of SmartChainFlow is exposed through smart contract function calls. The primary contract is the `ArbitrageExecutor` contract, which handles the execution of arbitrage trades.

Example: Initiating an arbitrage trade:

The specific implementation details of the `ArbitrageExecutor` contract can be found in the `contracts` directory. API documentation for the smart contracts will be provided in a separate document.
